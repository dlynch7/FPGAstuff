# Switches_LEDs

I am following [Hamsterworks](http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)' instructions for creating my first FPGA project, named "Switches_LEDs". I am using a different board (the [Papilio Pro LX9](http://papilio.gadgetfactory.net/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro))than the ones he suggests, so this doc serves to keep track of the differences between my workflow and the one he documents in his [Intro to Spartan FPGA](https://github.com/hamsternz/IntroToSpartanFPGABook/blob/master/IntroToSpartanFPGABook.pdf) book.

## ToC

## Creating a new project
The Papilio Pro uses a different FPGA than the development boards suggested in the Hamsterworks book.
